    <h1>Big Infra Twist… Are You Ready for What’s Coming?</h1>

    <h2>About the Company</h2>
    <p>Kalpataru Projects International Limited (KPIL), formerly Kalpataru Power Transmission Limited, is one of India’s biggest EPC powerhouses. With expertise in power, buildings, railways, water, pipelines, highways, and airports, KPIL has built projects across 30+ countries and has a footprint in 75 nations.</p>

    <h2>The Big Development</h2>
    <p>On October 23, 2025, KPIL announced it has secured major fresh contracts across two critical areas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Global Power Transmission & Distribution projects</li>
      <li>Domestic Buildings & Factories contracts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Together, these orders are valued in thousands of crores and take KPIL’s FY26 inflows to nearly ₹15,000 crore, marking a 25% growth over last year.</p>

    <h2>Impact on the Market</h2>
    <p>The wins underline strong demand in both global T&D and India’s infrastructure cycle. Domestically, the Buildings & Factories segment highlights expanding industrial and commercial activity. The optimism is reflected in the stock price — KPIL opened at ₹1,284 today and traded between ₹1,252–₹1,284 versus its previous close of ₹1,269.70. The steady action suggests investors already see strength in KPIL’s order book, which may support broader infra and capital goods sentiment.</p>

    <h2>Why It Matters for India</h2>
    <p>Such inflows highlight a booming infrastructure and power cycle. Rising demand in the Buildings & Factories segment shows India’s manufacturing and commercial expansion, which could boost jobs, capital flows, and investor sentiment in infra-linked stocks.</p>

    <h2>Trends Shaping the Sector</h2>
    <p>India’s infrastructure growth is being fueled by heavy public spending and rising private investments. Globally, increasing energy demand is boosting cross-border transmission projects. At the same time, sustainability and digital technologies are emerging as key drivers shaping the future of EPC leaders.</p>

    <h2>Investor Angle</h2>
    <p>For investors, order wins are positive, but real success depends on execution, profitability, and managing overseas risks. A strong pipeline exists, but delivery discipline is what will define the real winners in this cycle.</p>
